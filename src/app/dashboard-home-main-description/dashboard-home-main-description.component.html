        I am a recent undergraduate in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, now pursuing a Master of Science. With a strong background in embedded systems, digital signal processing, and control systems, my goal is to further explore how to utilize computer vision and sensors to better aid autonomous agents in making logical reasons. I also have experience in other areas including machine learning, distributed systems, and full-stack development. 
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        My motivation for putting this website together was to cultivate my front-end development skills as well as bring forth a personalized portfolio describing who I am and what I have accomplished throughout my academic career. It also serves as a creative outlet to share my experiences and introduce projects that others will hopefully find interesting and even helpful for their own learning endeavors. As I continue with my educational journey, I hope to expand this portfolio and eventually be a part of a generation of engineers that tackles the many difficult challenges that we face today.       </p>

          Taking AP Computer Science Principles in high school is what peaked my interest in programming and led me to pursue computer engineering. I was more enticed by the software aspect at the time and seeing how much of a creative outlet it gave people. I remember my first dream was creating a gaming app for the app store and having it trend. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My only issue at the time was that I had never coded in my life and felt I wasn’t capable and didn’t have the knowledge to do so.

        <p>
          Despite that, I applied and got accepted to U of I for computer engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The courses I’ve taken have only empowered me and helped me grow in confidence with my ability to code and work with hardware. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve grown a deep appreciation for computers and the impact they can have around us. All I hope for is a career where I can continue to learn and grow, and make a meaningful impact on whatever projects I tackle.

    <h2>Computer Systems Engineering (ECE 391)</h2>
    <h3>Spring 2022</h3>
    <p>
      The prime goal of this class was to get students familiar with the design decisions and the implementation of Linux Kernel. Through this class, I learned key concepts when developing a kernel such as how to organize a file system, displaying data through a VGA port in ModeX, configuring virtual memory, and how to implement a scheduler so that a kernel can contain multiple tabs running programs simultaneously. There were three machine problems for this class where the first was in x86 assembly and the last two were in C. The third machine problem was also the final project which involved creating a basic Linux kernel with the aforementioned concepts such as a file system, virtual memory, paging, and a scheduler.

    <h2>Digital Systems Labratory (ECE 385)</h2>
    <h3>Fall 2021</h3>
    <p>
      The core focus of this class was getting us familiar with FPGA boards and simulation synthesis with the assistance of Intel's Quartus. For hardware synthesis, we used System Verilog. In this class, we had a variety of machine problems that involved configuring the FPGA to receive keyboard input and display to a monitor using a VGA port. I also became familiar with instantiating memory on an FPGA board and designing finite state machines for components on the FPGA board that needed to be communicated with over multiple clock cycles such as the SDRAM. My biggest key takeaway from this class was learning how to debug hardware by analyzing waveform signals and following close instructions to given documentation and timing requirements for components such as SDRAM.
    </p>
    <p>
      This class had a final project where we were allowed to freely demonstrate our skills and knowledge of FPGA synthesis by implementing whatever we wanted, and our grade was based on the difficulty of our implementation. With a fellow peer, we created a hybrid of a Flappy Bird and Google's infamous, no-internet dinosaur game. This required us to set up communication between the FPGA and a keyboard and monitor, as well as using SDRAM to hold image frames of the game. The final project was a success, and the last thing we wish we could have set up was the onboard sound card on the FPGA so that there could be sound and music to go along with the game.

      <h2>VEXU Robotics -- Controls/Vision Programmer</h2>
      <h3>Fall 2022 - Now</h3>
      <p>
        VEXU is a university level robotic competition where the tasks for a university's robots are different each year. For the current school year, the challenge is placing as many disks as possible in the opponent’s corner before the timer runs out. There is also a skills portion where a robot needs to make as many disks into a hoop as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are creating three robots, two for the main competitions, and one for the skills competition. My responsibility as a programmer is to write the controls for the robot to enable autonomous and man operated movement. For vision, we are using a Raspberry PI and external camera to identify the field and yellow disks so that for the autonomous portion, the robots can collect their disks and place them at their destination.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm most excited for contributing to the vision of our robots since the artificial intelligence and principles of safe autonomy courses are extremely relevant for computer vision and autonomous operations. Seeing this overlap between my courses and RSO project brings me a lot of energy since it makes me realize our potential for creating a robot that can place in the VEXU competition.

      <p>
        That is no typo, I was a mechanical engineer for Illini Solar Car. My prime motivation was that I wanted to gain experience that I knew I would never encounter in my courses, and I saw Illini Solar as the perfect opportunity to do so. Even now, I've gained a lot of opportunities in my college career to expand my technical knowledge and it's such an enjoyable experience diving into something new. Thanks to Solar Car, I learned basic CAD programming with Creo, and what it meant to collaboratively work with fellow engineers to reach an end goal.

      </p>
      <p>
        By this point, I had finally become familiar with C/C++ and was happy to be able to use those skills in practice by working with a mechanically printed hand. As the lead of the software team for the semester, I hosted meetings twice a week and helped my fellow peers catch up to speed with C/C++. Together, we sifted through Arduino documentation, and it was always an amazing feeling seeing our progress translate into a hand capable of moving and responding to keyboard input.

              During the summer of 2022, I had a chance to tackle a project involved with embedded systems as well as digital signal processing. It was 
              a very involved experience and it led me to appreciate digital signal processing a lot more, a field that I previously didn't grasp as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
              By working with an <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/ADALM-PLUTO.html#eb-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adalm Pluto SDR Learning Module</a> 
              and a software defined radio, I was able to apply digital signal processing to real world signals and thus, gained invaluable experience that 
              gave me a good knowledgeable foundation of the topic. Due to hardware limitations of the software defined radio that I was programming, 
              I had to seek creative measures to preserve memory while still being able to use this radio to listen to radio frequencies for hours on end and 
              characterize its findings.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found the project to be so much fun that I ended up buying my own personal Adalm Pluto SDR and creating scripts for it that used its full 
              capabilities. This <a href="https://github.com/jorgejc2/PlutoSDR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> is to my github page that contains scripts that can be run on a Pluto and has instructions on how to set one up.
