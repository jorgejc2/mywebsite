            <strong>Digital Signal Processing was a topic I believed I would never figure out.</strong> That mentality completely changed after interning with 
            Motorola Solutions the summer of 2022. When I had applied for the internship, it was for a role in embedded systems, but as the start date of the internship 
            approached, my manager gave me more details on the project I was going to work on. It was still in the realm of embedded systems, but little did I know that I 
            would be working with a software defined radio prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
            In essence, the project I was tasked with was creating a software module in Python that would allow this software defined radio to be able to pick up 
            radio frequency activity for hours on end, and then process the signals that the radio picked up and be able to describe their attributes. The attributes to be defined 
            included sthe center frequency a signal was found at, what time a signal was found, its bandwidth, its amplitude in decibals, and how many times the signal appeared on and off. 
            Why was this script so important to the device? Well, the main purpose of this software defined radio was to fake the presence of radio frequency activity. 
            Radio frequencies are everywhere, and they are essential to communication. There are standards such as LTE, Bluetooth, TDMR, Wifi, and even the radio frequencies that 
            come out of your microwave. It's difficult to try and mask the radio frequencies that you may use for communication. That's why this radio intentionally 
            sent out radio frequency activity so that anyone trying to listen in on the RF activity going on, would be misled to thinking that a group of people have set up a base 
            of communication in a certain location. In reality, this small device is just pumping out meaningless signals with no one near. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm of course, exaggerating a little bit when I said that the SDR pumped out meaningless data. If it was purely meaningless data, others trying to listen in would 
            eventually catch on. In order to emit signals, .wav files needed to be loaded onto the device while also configuring the device to pump out these .wav files at certain 
            frequencies at intervals. It could also be loaded with pure IQ sample data and pump that information from the device as well. <a href="https://www.tek.com/en/blog/quadrature-iq-signals-explained#:~:text=Quadrature%20signals%2C%20also%20called%20IQ,as%20in%20complex%20signal%20analysis." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IQ samples</a> are the digital samples 
            of signals interpreted by an SDR.
